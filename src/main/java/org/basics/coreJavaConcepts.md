### Basic Terms
- Literals: Any data that can be assigned to a variable is called literal.

### Obsidian Notes: Core Java Concepts

#### 1. **Static Block Execution**
- **What is a static block?**  
  A `static` block in Java is a block of code that gets executed when the class is first loaded into memory, before any instance of the class is created.

- **Key Concept:**  
  Static blocks are executed **once** per class load and are useful for initializing static variables. They execute **before the constructor**.

- **Example:**
  ```java
  public class Test {
      static {
          int x = 20;
          System.out.print(x + " ");  // This executes first
      }

      int x = 10;
      
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Test t = new Test();
          System.out.println(t.x);  // Then this prints the value of instance variable x
      }
  }
  // Output: 20 10
  ```

---

#### 2. **Primitive Types vs. Wrapper Classes**
- **Primitive Data Types:**  
  Java has eight primitive data types: `int`, `char`, `double`, `boolean`, `float`,`long`, `short`, `byte`.

- **Wrapper Classes:**  
  Every primitive data type has an equivalent wrapper class (e.g., `Integer` for `int`, `Double` for `double`). Wrapper classes are used for working with collections, nullability, and object-related operations.

- **Methods in Wrapper Classes:**
    - `Integer.parseInt()`: Converts a `String` to an `int`.
    - `Integer.valueOf()`: Converts a `String` or `int` to an `Integer` object.
    - Constants like `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.

- **Example:**
  ```java
  int num = 5;  // Primitive
  Integer wrapperNum = Integer.valueOf(num);  // Wrapper class
  System.out.println(Integer.MAX_VALUE);  // Prints the maximum value an int can hold
  ```

---

#### 3. **Difference Between `==` and `.equals()`**
- **`==` Operator:**  
  Compares **references** (for objects) and **values** (for primitives).

- **`.equals()` Method:**  
  Used to compare the actual **content** or **values** inside the object.

- **Example:**
  ```java
  Integer a = new Integer(10);
  Integer b = new Integer(10);

  System.out.println(a == b);        // false (compares references)
  System.out.println(a.equals(b));   // true (compares values)
  ```

---

#### 4. **The `final` Keyword**
- **Variables:**  
  Once a variable is declared as `final`, its value cannot be changed.

- **Methods:**  
  A `final` method cannot be overridden by subclasses.

- **Classes:**  
  A `final` class cannot be subclassed (e.g., `String` is a `final` class in Java).

- **Example:**
  ```java
  final int x = 10;
  x = 20;  // Error: cannot assign a value to final variable
  ```

---

#### 5. **String Immutability**
- **What does immutable mean?**  
  Once a `String` object is created, it cannot be modified. Any operations like concatenation or substring creation result in new `String` objects being created.

- **Why are Strings immutable?**  
  Immutability helps in **security**, **performance** (string pool), and **thread safety**.

- **Example:**
  ```java
  String s = "Hello";
  s = s.concat(" World");  // A new String object is created
  System.out.println(s);   // "Hello World"
  ```

---

#### 6. **Garbage Collection**
- **What is garbage collection?**  
  Garbage collection is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management. Java automatically removes objects that are no longer reachable in memory.

- **Key Concept:**  
  You can't force garbage collection, but you can **suggest** it using `System.gc()`. Java's garbage collector uses algorithms like **Mark and Sweep** to reclaim memory.

---

#### 7. **Exceptions and Exception Handling**
- **Checked Exceptions:**  
  These are exceptions that must be either caught or declared in the method using `throws`.  
  **Examples:**
    - `IOException`
    - `SQLException`
    - `FileNotFoundException`

- **Unchecked Exceptions:**  
  These are exceptions that are not required to be handled.  
  **Examples:**
    - `NullPointerException`
    - `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`
    - `ArithmeticException`
    - `IllegalArgumentException`

- **Try-Catch Block:**  
  A mechanism to handle exceptions to avoid program crashes.

  ```java
  try {
      int result = 10 / 0;
  } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
      System.out.println("Division by zero error.");
  } finally {
      System.out.println("This will always execute.");
  }
  ```

---

#### 8. **Constructors**
- **Default Constructor:**  
  If no constructor is defined, Java provides a no-argument default constructor.

- **Parameterized Constructor:**  
  A constructor with parameters to initialize objects with different values.

- **Constructor Overloading:**  
  Having multiple constructors with different parameter lists in the same class.

---

#### 9. **The `this` Keyword**
- **What is `this`?**  
  The `this` keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.

- **Usage:**
    1. To avoid naming conflicts between instance variables and parameters.
    2. To call other constructors within the same class.

- **Example:**
  ```java
  public class Example {
      int x;
      
      Example(int x) {
          this.x = x;  // this.x refers to the instance variable
      }
  }
  ```

---

#### 10. **Method Overloading vs. Method Overriding**
- **Method Overloading:**  
  Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.

- **Method Overriding:**  
  Redefining a method of a parent class in a subclass with the same method signature.

- **Example of Overloading:**
  ```java
  public int add(int a, int b) {
      return a + b;
  }
  
  public double add(double a, double b) {
      return a + b;
  }
  ```

- **Example of Overriding:**
  ```java
  class Parent {
      void show() {
          System.out.println("Parent class");
      }
  }

  class Child extends Parent {
      @Override
      void show() {
          System.out.println("Child class");
      }
  }
  ```

---

#### 11. **Access Modifiers**
- **Public:** Accessible from any class.
- **Private:** Accessible only within the same class.
- **Protected:** Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
- **Default (Package-Private):** Accessible only within the same package.

---

#### 12. **Threads & Multithreading**
- **What are threads in JAVA?**

  In Java, a thread is the smallest unit of execution within a program. It represents a single path of execution, 
  allowing multiple threads to run concurrently within a Java application. Threads are essential for multitasking and 
  parallel processing, enabling efficient use of CPU resources.

Key Features of Threads in Java
- Main Thread: Every Java program starts with a default thread called the "main thread," created by the JVM. It invokes the main() method12.

- Concurrency: Threads allow multiple operations to execute simultaneously, improving performance for tasks like background processing or I/O operations23.

- Independent Execution: Threads share memory but run independently. Exceptions in one thread do not affect others


- **What is Multithreading?**  
  Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more threads for maximum utilization of CPU.

- **Creating Threads:**
    1. **By Extending `Thread` Class:**
       ```java
       class MyThread extends Thread {
           public void run() {
               System.out.println("Thread running");
           }
       }
  
       public class Test {
           public static void main(String[] args) {
               MyThread t = new MyThread();
               t.start();
           }
       }
       ```
    2. **By Implementing `Runnable` Interface:**
       ```java
       class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
           public void run() {
               System.out.println("Runnable thread running");
           }
       }
  
       public class Test {
           public static void main(String[] args) {
               Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
               t.start();
           }
       }
       ```

- **Thread Lifecycle Methods:**
    - `start()`: Starts the thread.
    - `run()`: Contains the code executed by the thread.
    - `sleep(long millis)`: Pauses the thread for the specified time.
    - `join()`: Waits for the thread to finish execution.

---

#### 13. **Thread Safety**
- **What is Thread Safety?**  
  Thread safety ensures that shared data is accessed by multiple threads without causing inconsistencies or unexpected behavior.

- **Synchronization:**
    - **Synchronized Methods:**  
      Ensures that only one thread can access a method at a time.
      ```java
      public synchronized void increment() {
          count++;
      }
      ```
    - **Synchronized Blocks:**  
      Fine-grained control over synchronization.
      ```java
      public void increment() {
          synchronized(this) {
              count++;
          }
      }
      ```

- **Volatile Keyword:**  
  Declares a variable as `volatile` to ensure visibility of its changes across threads.
  ```java
  private volatile boolean flag = true;
  ```

- **Concurrent Collections:**  
  Use classes from `java.util.concurrent` package like `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList` for thread-safe operations.

---

#### 14. **Inbuilt Exceptions in Java**
- **List of Common Inbuilt Exceptions:**
    - **ArithmeticException:**  
      Thrown when an exceptional arithmetic condition occurs

(e.g., division by zero).
- **NullPointerException:**  
Thrown when attempting to access an object through a `null` reference.
- **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:**  
Thrown when attempting to access an array with an illegal index.
- **ClassCastException:**  
Thrown when an object is incorrectly cast to another class.

---

#### 15. **Java Packages**
- **What are Packages?**  
  A package in Java is a namespace that organizes classes and interfaces, preventing naming conflicts and providing access protection.

- **Types of Packages:**
    1. **Built-in Packages:**  
       Java provides a rich set of pre-built packages like `java.util`, `java.io`, `java.lang`.
    2. **User-defined Packages:**  
       You can create your own packages to organize classes.

  **Example of Package Declaration:**
  ```java
  package myPackage;
  
  public class MyClass {
      // class code
  }
  ```

---

#### 16. **Collections in Java**
- **List Interface:**  
  An ordered collection (also known as a sequence).
  ```java
  List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
  list.add("Apple");
  list.add("Banana");
  ```

- **Set Interface:**  
  A collection that contains no duplicate elements.
  ```java
  Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
  set.add("Apple");
  set.add("Banana");
  ```

- **Map Interface:**  
  An object that maps keys to values. Duplicate keys are not allowed.
  ```java
  Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
  map.put("Apple", 1);
  map.put("Banana", 2);
  ```

- **Queue Interface:**  
  A collection for holding elements before processing, following FIFO (First In, First Out) order.
  ```java
  Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
  queue.add("Apple");
  queue.add("Banana");
  ```

---

#### 17. **Generics**
- **What are Generics?**  
  Generics allow types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces, and methods. This helps achieve type safety and reduces the need for typecasting.

- **Example of Generic Class:**
  ```java
  public class Box<T> {
      private T t;
  
      public void set(T t) {
          this.t = t;
      }
  
      public T get() {
          return t;
      }
  }
  ```

---

#### 18. **Streams API**
- **What is Streams API?**  
  Introduced in Java 8, the Streams API is used to process collections of objects in a functional style, allowing operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing.

- **Example:**
  ```java
  List<String> list = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "orange");
  List<String> filteredList = list.stream()
                                  .filter(s -> s.startsWith("a"))
                                  .collect(Collectors.toList());
  ```

---

#### 19. **Lambda Expressions**
- **What are Lambda Expressions?**  
  Lambda expressions are a way to provide a clear and concise syntax for writing anonymous methods (functions). They are used to implement functional interfaces in Java.

- **Syntax:**
  ```java
  (parameters) -> expression
  (parameters) -> { statements; }
  ```

- **Example:**
  ```java
  List<String> list = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "orange");
  list.forEach(s -> System.out.println(s));
  ```

---

#### 20. **Optional Class**
- **What is the `Optional` class?**  
  Introduced in Java 8, `Optional` is a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value. It is used to avoid null pointer exceptions.

- **Example:**
  ```java
  Optional<String> opt = Optional.ofNullable(null);
  System.out.println(opt.isPresent());  // false
  ```

---

#### 21. **Conditionals**

- **If-Else:**
    - Basic conditional statement used to execute code based on whether a condition is true or false.
    - Example:
      ```java
      int x = 10;
      if (x > 5) {
          System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
      } else {
          System.out.println("x is less than or equal to 5");
      }
      ```

- **Switch Case:**
    - An alternative to multiple `if-else` conditions, commonly used for handling multiple discrete values of a variable.
    - Example:
      ```java
      int day = 2;
      switch(day) {
          case 1:
              System.out.println("Sunday");
              break;
          case 2:
              System.out.println("Monday");
              break;
          default:
              System.out.println("Invalid day");
      }
      ```

---

#### 22. **Loops**

- **For Loop:**
    - Executes a block of code a fixed number of times.
    - Example:
      ```java
      for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
          System.out.println("i: " + i);
      }
      ```

- **While Loop:**
    - Executes a block of code as long as the condition remains true.
    - Example:
      ```java
      int i = 0;
      while (i < 5) {
          System.out.println("i: " + i);
          i++;
      }
      ```

- **Do-While Loop:**
    - Similar to the `while` loop, but ensures the loop is executed at least once before checking the condition.
    - Example:
      ```java
      int i = 0;
      do {
          System.out.println("i: " + i);
          i++;
      } while (i < 5);
      ```

---

#### 23. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**

- Interfaces:

  
  An interface in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. The methods in interfaces are abstract by default.
  A class implements an interface to provide concrete implementations of its abstract methods.

```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

- Abstract Classes:

An abstract class cannot be instantiated and can have both abstract and concrete methods. A class can inherit from an abstract class and provide implementations for abstract methods.
NOTE: A single abstract method declared inside a class makes that class as abstract.

1. If you are creating a new class and extending an Abstract class, then you will need to override ALL the abstract methods present in the abstract class.
   (ऐसा नहीं करोगे तो वह एरर देगा।)
2. We can create a `concrete`class from an `abstract` class by implementing all the abstract methods present in the abstract class. Or you can create another `abstract` class from existing `abstract` class if you dont implement all of its methods.
(```जब तक सारे एब्स्ट्रैक्ट मेथड्स को इम्प्लीमेंट नहीं करोगे, तब तक कंक्रीट क्लास नहीं बनेगी। जब तक कंक्रीट क्लास नहीं बनेगी, तब तक ऑब्जेक्ट नहीं बना पाओगे।```)
```java

abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();  // Abstract method
    void sleep() {          // Concrete method
        System.out.println("Sleeping");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

---

#### 24. **Enum Types**

- What are Enums?

An enum in Java is a special class that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables). Enums are used to represent fixed sets of related constants in a more type-safe way.

```java
enum Day {
  SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY;
}

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Day today = Day.MONDAY;
    System.out.println(today);
  }
}
```
